# OpenMusE Statistical Yearbook (T1.3_statistical_yearbook) – Replication Repository

## Description

This repository contains the documentation, code, and statistical outputs underlying the OpenMusE Statistical Yearbook.

The scripts reproduce the tables presented in the Statistical Yearbook using official Eurostat data sources. All indicators are fully replicable.

### 1. Document/

Contains:

- The OpenMusE Statistical Yearbook (final deliverable)

This directory includes the published statistical report to which the tables refer.

---

### 2. Code/

Contains all R scripts used to generate the statistical tables.

The scripts cover:

- Employment indicators  
- Structural Business Statistics (SBS)  
- Cultural trade statistics  
- Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)  

Each module:
- Downloads data directly from Eurostat via API
- Applies the relevant filters and transformations
- Produces formatted tables and accompanying legends

All scripts are self-contained and reproducible.

---

### 3. Output/

Contains the statistical tables generated by the code.

Outputs include:

- EU27 aggregate tables  
- Country-level tables  
- CSV and/or Excel formats  
- Legend files documenting data sources and transformations  

All files in this directory can be regenerated by running the scripts in the `Code/` folder.

---

## Data Sources

All data are retrieved from Eurostat:

- Structural Business Statistics  
- Cultural trade statistics  
- Employment statistics  
- Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices  

Data are accessed via the `eurostat` R package.

---

## Reproducibility

To reproduce the tables:

1. Install required R packages (`eurostat`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `readr`, `openxlsx`)
2. Run the scripts contained in the `Code/` directory
3. Generated tables will be written to the `Output/` directory

All results are generated directly from official Eurostat datasets.
